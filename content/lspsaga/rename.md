### Change start mode from command

In some situation like just want change one or less characters. `in_select` will cause a trouble. Now you can pass
mode from command like `:Lspsaga lsp_rename mode=n`.

## Project Replace

lsp rename only can rename language file in doc or some other places lsp not handle that. Lspsaga provide async project
level search and replace by using `rg`. make sure you install `rg`.

- use `rename.keys.exec` to execute new_name replace.

### Integration lsp rename
